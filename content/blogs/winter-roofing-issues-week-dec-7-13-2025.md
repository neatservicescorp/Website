Short days, snow flurries, and freeze-thaw swings can expose every weak spot on your roof. The week of December 7-13 is when we see ice dams forming, loose flashing lifting, and shingles cracking under temperature swings. Catching these issues now prevents leaks, insulation damage, and emergency calls when the next storm hits.

## Top Winter Failures We See This Week

*   Ice dams pushing meltwater under shingles and into attics
*   Wind-lifted ridge caps and flashing around chimneys
*   Brittle, cracked shingles from rapid freeze-thaw cycles
*   Clogged gutters forcing water over the fascia
*   Backed-up attic moisture from blocked vents
*   Loose fasteners on skylights and satellite mounts

## Attic Clues That Trouble Is Starting

Your attic often tells the story before the ceiling does. A five-minute check with a flashlight can reveal moisture and heat loss long before stains reach drywall.

*   Frost on underside of roof deck after cold nights
*   Darkened insulation or damp batts near eaves
*   Rust on nails poking through sheathing
*   Musty odor or visible drip trails along rafters

## Quick Diagnostics You Can Do from the Ground

*   Look for uneven snow melt lines—often a sign of heat loss
*   Check gutters for icicles or overflow stains
*   Scan ridge and eave lines for lifted shingle edges
*   Listen in the attic during wind for rattling or drips

## Preventive Moves Before the Next Snowfall

Small steps lower the odds of mid-storm leaks. Think airflow, drainage, and secure edges so meltwater and wind have nowhere to exploit.

*   Add or clear soffit/ridge vent pathways to balance attic temps
*   Trim back branches that can scrape shingles when iced
*   Verify gutter outlets are open and extensions are connected
*   Re-secure any loose step flashing at walls or dormers

## When to Call a Roofing Pro Immediately

If you see interior stains, hear dripping, or notice sagging insulation, act fast. The cost of waiting during winter multiplies as water travels and temperatures drop. A professional inspection can isolate the source, secure loose components, and protect your insulation and framing before repairs get expensive.
