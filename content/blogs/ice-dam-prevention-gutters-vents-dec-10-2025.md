Ice dams build quietly when attic heat melts snow and cold eaves refreeze it. The combination of clean gutters, balanced ventilation, and sealed flashing keeps meltwater moving. Mid-December is the moment to tune these details before back-to-back storms roll through.

## Essential Moves to Keep Water Flowing

*   Clear gutters/downspouts so meltwater exits fast
*   Confirm baffles keep attic airflow unobstructed
*   Seal and re-caulk flashing at chimneys and valleys
*   Add heat cables only where design allows safe routing

## What Balanced Ventilation Looks Like

Soffit intake plus ridge or roof vents should move air evenly across the attic. If you see frost on sheathing, damp insulation, or uneven snow melt, airflow is likely off. Correcting this prevents condensation that feeds mold and ice dams alike.

## Common Mistakes That Create Ice Dams

*   Blocking soffit vents with insulation baffles installed backwards
*   Exhausting bath fans into the attic instead of outdoors
*   Skipping drip edge or ice-and-water shield at eaves
*   Letting gutter guards clog and trap meltwater

These errors add heat and moisture exactly where ice dams form. A quick audit now saves you from ceiling stains mid-winter.
