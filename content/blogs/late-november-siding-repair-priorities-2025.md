The final week of November is your last warm-enough stretch to prep siding for winter. Tightening the exterior now prevents drafts, water intrusion, and swollen trim once freeze-thaw cycles begin.

## Checklist to Finish Before Temperatures Drop

*   Swap any soft, rotten, or delaminating boards
*   Inspect window and door flashings for gaps
*   Touch up sealant at utility penetrations
*   Clean siding to reveal hidden cracks or nail pops
*   Confirm downspouts discharge away from foundation

## Why These Repairs Can’t Wait

Moisture that gets behind siding in late fall can freeze, expand, and split panels. Addressing vulnerabilities before the first hard freeze protects sheathing, insulation, and interior finishes, keeping winter energy bills in check.

## Tools and Materials That Speed Things Up

*   Low-temp exterior caulk for late-fall sealing
*   Moisture meter to check questionable trim before repainting
*   Flashlight and mirror for tight spots behind meter bases
*   Drip cap stock to refresh tired head flashings over windows

Having the right kit on hand turns a weekend scramble into a focused, high-quality repair session before the freeze.
